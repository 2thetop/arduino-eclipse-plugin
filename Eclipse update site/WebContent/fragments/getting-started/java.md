Java
====
Java is a platform independent interpreted language. This means that once you have "build a java program the program can only run in a "java interpreter".

Java interpreters have been written for windows, Linux and Mac. As such Java is called platform independent.

Older versions of the plugin were happy with java 6. Currently Java 7 is needed and you're safer installing the SDK version. Most people have multiple java versions on their machine.

The Arduino IDE uses java and so does eclipse.

Mac users
=========
Mac used to deliver it's own flavor of java but no longer. Install java from the oracle web site like everybody else.
