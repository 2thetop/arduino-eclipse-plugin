Eclipse
=======
Eclipse is a open source, platform independent, graphical environment based on java.
It originated from an IDE (integrated development environment) but today it is more a extensible framework than an IDE. 
The biggest advantage of eclipse is that is supports (via plugins) all kinds of development. For instance I do web/lua/arduino/bash development in the same project using the same version control tool.
