Arduino Eclipse plugin
======================
The arduino eclipse plugin is the part that makes the life of a arduino developer easier in Eclipse CDT. Simply put: eclipse/CDT knows how to build a C/C++ project with all ins and outs; the arduino eclipse plugins tells it the ins and outs needed for Arduino development. 
The plugin started as a plugin that needs to be installed on a eclipse environment that holds the eclipse CDT plugin. Later we bundled the plugin with CDT and eclipse as a product. 
Apart from the CDT integration part the plugin also delivers
